/*

You  are  given  an  array prices where prices[i] is  the  price  of  a  given  stock  on  the ith day.Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0. 

Example 1:
Input:prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6,  4]   
Output:   5 
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


Example 2:
Input:Prices = [7, 6, 4,  3, 1]   
Output:   0 
Explanation:In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Constraints:
• 1<= prices. length <= 105
• 0<= prices [ i ] <= 104
